## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is an app idea I got after talking to many of my friends who are mothers, such as myself. We enjoy going to various places around town but don't always feel welcomed to bring our children with us. Places like a fancier resturant or a park that has a moderate hiking trail, would be a bit of information to know if bringing a child to would be accepatble of not. My app would allow people to rate a review places on "kid friendliness" and ultimately break the stigma on people bringing kids with them everywhere. Outside of the obvious establishments suchs as bars, or perhaps courthouses but even these places could be rated in the app as a lower rating on the kidliness scale.
Working title is "Parent Portal", I'm also playing with something incorporating my daughter's name, Luella as well. "Looping Louie" is something that i am brain storming with but i know a title will happen naturally. 
I would lastly like to end this overview by saying that this app would be similar to Yelp but with a focus on kid friendliness.
