# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is an app idea I got after talking to many of my friends who are mothers, such as myself. We are adventurous and love the outdoors so, naturally we want to take our children with us on our adventures. This app is called, "Take a Hike, Kid!" and its where people can gauge the kid friendliness of various parks and trail in the St. Louis and surrounding areas. I want to eventually work up to state-wide as well as nation-wide but for now i wish to focus on just the St. Louis region. It will also be a way for people to decide on what trails are absolutely not safe for kids and might also help people who want to avoid kids on the trails and camp grounds too. My app would allow people to rate a review places on "kid friendliness" and ultimately break the stigma on people bringing kids with them to enjoy the great outdoors and show how kids get so much out of being outside. This idea all started from an idea I had about a Kid-version of Yelp. And then i wanted to downsize the idea to something more focused and hiking is something of a passion of mine and something i share with my daughter too. So I felt that hiking and outdoor activites would be a great place to start.

### Features - these might be cut but they are some of my favorite ideas right now.

2) Search: Users will be able to search for different parks and trails.
3) Rate: Users will be able to give a rating on parks and trails.
4) Comment: Users will be able to give comments on different businesses 
5) Invite: Users will be able to invite other users to join the app.
6) Add: Users will add their parks and trails to be voted on.
7) Favorites: Users will have a list of favorite parks and trails.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn more about incorporating APIs into my application because i would like to implement a map API. I would also like to have a photo uploading system inplace where a user can upload a photo of the place they visited.
